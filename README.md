# REFERENCES / REMINDERS
1. Per Xuan's lecture on March 23rd, use this as a good example for autocorrealtion: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-calculate-autocorrelation-in-python/

# TODO
1. ~~Create Subdirectory /source_data~~
2. Neatly Copy Data into /source_data
3. Assign work based on Data Questions

# Data Questions
1. Do we have enough care providers to accommodate the population in Canada (nationally, provincially, municipally)***@lenosdilara***
    * Number of persons with a care provider versus not (Doctor of Nurse Practitioner)
    * Given each region (municipality for example) the number of persons versus the number of available care providers
2. How many ER visits are there which are not an emergency and could have instead been handled via other means (Telehealth Ontario, Walk-In, Primary Care Provider, etc.) @crhultay
    * How many Urgent Care / Walk-In Clinics were there in relation to the ER visits which were non-urgent?
4. Walk-In Clinic Closures per region @evanjmitchell
    * Number of persons who use third-party medical care tools such as RocketDoctor, etc.
    * Pre-COVID versus Post-COVID analyses
5. Doctors versus Nurse Practitioners @dema123khl
    * Question: Are provinces with a higher ratio of Nurse Practitioners to Doctors more likely to have better access to primary care?
    * Data Sets:
       * Health Workforce 2019-2023
       * Commonwealth Fund 2019 & 2022
    * How:
       * Calculate the Doctor-to-NP ratio per province.
       * Compare it with access to care statistics from the Commonwealth Fund dataset.
       * A simple correlation/ bar chart can show the relationship.
     
6. Does the availability of team-based care (doctors working with NPs or other health professionals) correlate with reduced wait times for primary care appointments across provinces?

    * Data Sources:
       * Health Workforce 2019-2023
       * Commonwealth Fund 2019 & 2022
   
7. Questions that will be difficult to answer based on data availability:
    * Population by Location combined with Clinic Locations and Doctors Registered per Clinic
    * Persons with access to a primary care provider based on demographic
